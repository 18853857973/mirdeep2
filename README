Script Reference:
----------------

miRDeep2 analyses can be performed using the three scripts miRDeep2.pl, mapper.pl and quantifier.pl.


name:
miRDeep2.pl

description:
Wrapper function for the miRDeep2.pl program package. The script runs all necessary scripts of the miRDeep2 package
to perform a microRNA detection deep sequencing data anlysis.

input:
A fasta file with deep sequencing reads, a fasta file of the corresponding genome, a file of mapped reads to the genome in miRDeep2 
arf format, an optional fasta file with known miRNAs of the analysing species and an option fasta file of known miRNAs of related 
species

output:
A spreadsheet and a html file with an overview of all detected miRNAs in the deep sequencing input data.


options:
-a int        minimum read stack height that triggers analysis. Using this option disables
              automatic estimation of the optimal value.
-b int        minimum score cut-off for predicted novel miRNAs to be displayed in the overview
              table. This score cut-off is by default 0.

-c            disable randfold analysis

-t species    species being analyzed - this is used to link to the appropriate UCSC browser

-u            output list of UCSC browser species that are supported and exit

-v            remove directory with temporary files

-q file       miRBase.mrd file from quantifier module to show miRBase miRNAs in data that were not scored by miRDeep2


Examples:

The miRDeep2 module identifies known and novel miRNAs in deep sequencing data. The output of the
mapper module can be directly plugged into the miRDeep2 module.


Example use 1:

The user wishes to identify miRNAs in mouse deep sequencing data, using default options. The 
miRBase_mmu_v14.fa file contains all miRBase mature mouse miRNAs, while the miRBase_rno_v14.fa
file contains all the miRBase mature rat miRNAs. The '2>' will pipe all progress output to the
report.log file.

miRDeep2.pl reads_collapsed.fa genome.fa reads_collapsed_vs_genome.arf miRBase_mmu_v14.fa miRBase_rno_v14.fa precursors_ref_this_species.fa -t Mouse 2>report.log

This command will generate a directory with pdfs showing the structures, read signatures and
score breakdowns of novel and known miRNAs in the data, an html webpage that links to all
results generated (result.html), a copy of the novel and known miRNAs contained in the webpage
but in text format which allows easy parsing (result.csv), a copy of the performance survey
contained in the webpage but in text format (survey.csv) and a copy of the miRNA read signatures
contained in the pdfs but in text format (output.mrd).
The ids in files miRBase_mmu_v14.fa and precursors_ref_this_species.fa need to be similar to each other.
This is usually no problem if you downloaded both files from miRBase.
Otherwise it can happen that the quantifier fails to produce results. 


Example use 2:

As in example use 1, except that the user has already run quantifier.pl and wants to use this
output to get information on the miRNAs not detected by miRDeep2 included in the html webpage.
miRBase.mrd is a file generated by quantifier.pl:

miRDeep2.pl reads_collapsed.fa genome.fa reads_collapsed_vs_genome.arf miRBase_mmu_v14.fa miRBase_rno_v14.fa -t Mouse -q miRBase.mrd 2>report.log

This command will generate the same type of files as example use 1 above.


The user wishes to identify miRNAs in deep sequencing data from an animal with no related species
in miRBase: 

miRDeep2.pl reads_collapsed.fa genome.fa reads_collapsed_vs_genome.arf none none none 2>report.log

This command will generate the same type of files as example use 1 above. Note that there it will
in practice always improve miRDeep2 performance if miRNAs from some related species is input, even
if it is not closely related.

name:
mapper.pl

description:
Processes reads and/or maps them to the reference genome. 

input:
Default input is a file in fasta, seq.txt or qseq.txt format. More input can be given depending
on the options used.

output:
The output depends on the options used (see below). Either a fasta file with processed reads or
an arf file with with mapped reads, or both, are output.

options:
Read input file:
-a              input file is seq.txt format
-b              input file is qseq.txt format
-c              input file is fasta format
-e              input file is fastq format
-d              input file is a config file (see miRDeep2 documentation).
                options -a, -b or -c must be given with option -d.


Preprocessing/mapping:
-g              three-letter prefix for reads (by default 'seq')
-h              parse to fasta format
-i              convert rna to dna alphabet (to map against genome)
-j              remove all entries that have a sequence that contains letters other than
                a,c,g,t,u,n,A,C,G,T,U,N
-k seq          clip 3' adapter sequence
-l int          discard reads shorter than int nts
-m              collapse reads
-p genome       map to genome (must be indexed by bowtie-build). The 'genome' string must be the
                prefix of the bowtie index. For instance, if the first indexed file is called
                'h_sapiens_37_asm.1.ebwt' then the prefix is 'h_sapiens_37_asm'.
-q              map with one mismatch in the seed (mapping takes longer)

Output files:
-s file         print processed reads to this file
-t file         print read mappings to this file 

Other:
-u              do not remove directory with temporary files
-v              outputs progress report

Examples:

The mapper module is designed as a tool to process deep sequencing reads and/or map them to the
reference genome. The module works in sequence space, and can process or map data that is in
sequence fasta format. A number of the functions of the mapper module are implemented specifically
with Solexa/Illumina data in mind. For example on how to post-process mappings in color space, see
example use 5:



Example use 1:

The user wishes to parse a file in qseq.txt format to fasta format, convert from RNA to DNA alphabet,
remove entries with non-canonical letters (letters other than a,c,g,t,u,n,A,C,G,T,U,N), clip adapters,
discard reads shorter than 18 nts and collapse the reads:
 
mapper.pl reads_qseq.txt -b -h -i -j -k TCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTGT -l 18 -m -s reads_collapsed.fa



Example use 2:

The user wishes to map a fasta file against the reference genome. The genome has already been
indexed by bowtie-build. The first of the indexed files is named genome.1.ebwt:

mapper.pl reads_collapsed.fa -c -p genome -t reads_collapsed_vs_genome.arf



Example use 3:

The user wishes to process the reads as in example use 1 and map the reads as in example use 2
in a single step, while observing the progress:

mapper.pl reads_qseq.txt -b -h -i -j -k TCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTGT -l 18 -m -p genome -s reads_collapsed.fa -t reads_collapsed_vs_genome.arf -v



Example use 4:

The user wishes to parse a GEO file to fasta format and process it as in example use 1. The GEO file
is in tabular format, with the first column showing the sequence and the second column showing the
read counts:

geo2fasta.pl GSM.txt > reads.fa

mapper.pl reads.fa -c -h -i -j -k TCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTGT -l 18 -m -s reads_collapsed.fa 



Example use 5: (experimental)

The user has already removed 3' adapters in color space and has mapped the reads against the genome
using bwa/bowtie resulting in a sam file. 
Note that each genome locus to which a read was aligned has to occur
in its own line. Otherwise only the first genome locus of each line will be taken!
The mapping output file is named mapped.sam. 
The user wishes to generate the files 'reads_collapsed.fa'
and 'reads_collapsed_vs_genome.arf' as input to miRDeep2:

perl sam_reads_collapse.pl mapped.sam reads_collapsed.fa
perl bwa_sam_converter.pl -i mapped.sam -t read_1_to_1.txt -o reads_collapsed_vs_genome.arf


If read ids are already collapsed and in correct miRDeep2 format (eg. ">ABC_1_x10", see File Formats at the bottom or consult the online documentation)
then the sam file just needs to be converted:


perl bwa_sam_converter.pl -i mapped.sam -o reads_collapsed_vs_genome.arf


Example use 6:

The user has sequencing data from different samples e.g. different cell-types. A config.txt file has to be created in which each line 
designates file locations and a unique 3 letter code. 
For instance:
sequencing_data_sample1.fa	sd1
sequencing_data_sample2.fa	sd2
sequencing_data_sample3.fa	sd3
.
.
.

The use wishes then to pool these files and use the generated files reads.fa and reads_vs_genome.fa for the miRDeep2 analysis. 


mapper.pl config.txt -d -c -i -j -l 18 -m -p genome_index -s reads.fa -t reads_vs_genome.arf 

Since the reads_vs_genome.arf still contains the 3 letter code for each read mapped to genome the user can then later on 
dilute the contribution of the different samples to a predicted or known miRNA.
It can also be used for example to define 'high confident' predictions if the results are filtered for miRNAs that have sequencing
evidence from at least two samples.   

############################################################################################################################### 


name:
quantifier.pl

description:
The module maps the deep sequencing reads to predefined miRNA precursors and determines by that the expression of the corresponding miRNAs.
First, the predefined mature miRNA sequences are mapped to the predefined precursors. Optionally, predefined star sequences can be mapped 
to the precursors too. By that the mature and star sequence in the precursors are determined.
Second, the deep sequencing reads are mapped to the precursors. The number of reads falling into an interval 2nt upstream and 5nt downstream 
of the mature/star sequence is determined.

input:
A fasta file with precursor sequences, a fasta file with mature miRNA sequences, a fasta file with deep sequencing reads and optionally a fasta
file with star sequences and the 3 letter code of the species of interest 

output:
A 2 column table file called miRNA_expressed.csv with miRNA identifiers and its read count, a file called miRNA_not_expressed.csv with all
miRNAs having 0 read counts, a signature file called miRBase.mrd, a file called expression.html that gives an overview of all miRNAs the input data
and a directory called pdfs that contains for each miRNA a pdf file showing its signature and structure. 

[options]

        -k           also considers precursor-mature mappings that have different ids, eg let7c
                     would be allowed to map to pre-let7a
        -n           do not do file conversion again

#####################################################################################################################################



name:
clip_adapters.pl

description:
Removes 3' end adaptors from deep sequenced small RNAs. The script searches for occurrences of the
six first nucleotides of the adapter in the read sequence, starting after position 18 in the read
sequence (so the shortest clipped read will be 18 nts). If no matches to the first six nts of the
adapter are identified in a read, the 3' end of the read is searched for shorter matches to the 5
to 1 first nts of the adapter.

input:
A fasta file with the deep sequencing reads and the adapter sequence (both in RNA or DNA alphabet).

output:
A fasta file with the clipped reads. Fasta ids are retained. If no matches to the adapter prefixes
are identified in a given read, the unclipped read is output.

options:
-

example usage:
clip_adapters.pl reads.fa TCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTGT > reads_clipped.fa

notes:
It is possible to clip adapters using more sophisticated methods. Users are encouraged to test other
methods with the miRDeep2 modules.



#####################################################################################################################################



name:
collapse_reads.pl

description:
Collapses reads in the fasta file to ensure that each sequence only occurs once. To indicate how
many times reads the sequence represents, a suffix is added to each fasta identifier. E.g. a
sequence that represents ten reads in the data will have the '_x10' suffix added to the identifier.

input:
A fasta file, either in standard format or in the collapsed suffix format.

output:
A fasta file in the collapsed suffix format.

options:
-a    outputs progress

example usage:
collapse_reads.pl reads.fa > reads_collapsed

notes:
Since the script reads all fasta entries into a hash using the sequence as key, it can potentially
use more than 3 GB memory when collapsing very big datasets, >50 million reads. In this case, the
user can partition the reads (for instance based on the 5' nucleotide), collapse separately and
concatenate.

name:
perform_controls.pl

description:
Performs a designated number of rounds of permuted controls (for details, see Friedlaender et al., Nature
Biotechnology, 2008).

input:
The permutation controls estimate the number of false positives produced by a miRDeep2_core_algorithm.pl run.
The input to perform_controls.pl should be a file containing the exact command line used to initiate the 
miRDeep2_core_algorithm.pl run, the structure file input to miRDeep2_core_algorithm.pl and the desired
rounds of controls.

output:
A file in .mrd format. The output of each control run is separated by a line 'permutation integer'. The mean
number of entries output by the control runs gives an estimate of the false positives produced. The further
contents (besides the number of entries) of the .mrd output by perform_controls.pl is not biologically
meaningful.

options:
-a   Output progress to screen

example usage:
perform_controls.pl line potential_precursors.str 100 > output_controls.mrd

name:
permute_structure.pl

description:
In a file output by RNAfold, each entry can be partitioned into an 'id' part and an 'other' part, consisting
of the dot-bracket structure, sequence, mfe etc. This scripts reads all 'id' parts into a hash and pairs
them with 'other' parts from random entries. This is used by the perform_controls.pl script.

input:
An RNAfold output file.

output:
An RNAfold output file with ids moved to random entries.

options:
-

example usage:
permute_structure.pl potential_precursors.str > potential_precursors_permuted.str

#####################################################################################################################################



name:
clip_adapters.pl

description:
Removes 3' end adaptors from deep sequenced small RNAs. The script searches for occurrences of the
six first nucleotides of the adapter in the read sequence, starting after position 18 in the read
sequence (so the shortest clipped read will be 18 nts). If no matches to the first six nts of the
adapter are identified in a read, the 3' end of the read is searched for shorter matches to the 5
to 1 first nts of the adapter.

input:
A fasta file with the deep sequencing reads and the adapter sequence (both in RNA or DNA alphabet).

output:
A fasta file with the clipped reads. Fasta ids are retained. If no matches to the adapter prefixes
are identified in a given read, the unclipped read is output.

options:
-

example usage:
clip_adapters.pl reads.fa TCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTGT > reads_clipped.fa

notes:
It is possible to clip adapters using more sophisticated methods. Users are encouraged to test other
methods with the miRDeep2 modules.

File Formats
.fa
The fasta files that contain sequencing reads used by miRDeep2 are ordinary fasta files with a predefined identifier format. It comprises three values separated by underscore. The first value is a three letter code which is intended to be a tag for the sample a read is coming from. The second value is a running number that is used to make sure that identifiers are uniquely assigned to sequences from the same sample. The third value starts with and 'x' followed by an integer number that indicates the occurrence of a read sequence in a sample. The sequence in a fasta file that is supplied to miRDeep2 is not allowed to contain characters others than A, C, G, T and N. If the id line or the sequence line do not follow these conventions miRDeep2 will abort with a warning message. Example entry from a fasta file that can be supplied to miRDeep2

>PAN_123456_x969696
ATACAATCTACTGTCTTTCCT

.arf
The arf format is a proprietary file format generated and processed by miRDeep2. It contains information of reads mapped to a reference genome. Each line in such a file contains 13 columns. Example line:
